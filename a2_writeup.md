# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
Conpleting the matc function was difficult in terms of trying to figure out what was the order to match the letters in, and also the code is sometimes overwhelming as the print lines have a lot of content inside. 
Also trying to analze the code before starting was difficult for me, but the intructions were pretty clear as to what they wanted to add or take out from the code. 

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
I could use the match function for extracting information from a movie datavase when looking for certain keywords that I want to find, and use this function for it to tell me that it is either true or false or if it returns something to me or not. This could also help me match movies together when I want to watch or look for a certain genre.
